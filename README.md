# SQL-Sales-Marketing-DataWarehouse

A complete SQL-based **data warehouse and ETL pipeline** for Sales & Marketing analytics using **Azure Data Factory**, **Azure Data Studio**, and **Azure SQL Database**.  
The project leverages **OLTP → OLAP transformations** and a **star-schema design** to provide advanced **business intelligence (BI) insights** into customer segmentation, sales optimization, discount impact, and demand forecasting.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Sales & Marketing Data Warehouse** for *Adventure Works Cycles*.  

It integrates multiple data sources into a centralized warehouse using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** for ETL workflows, enabling advanced analytics such as:
- Customer segmentation  
- Discount impact analysis  
- Demand forecasting  
- Trend and performance analysis  

By transforming OLTP structures into a denormalized OLAP schema, the project enables **efficient querying**, **high-performance analytics**, and **scalable reporting** for business decision-making.
