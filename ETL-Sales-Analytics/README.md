# Advanced Sales & Marketing Data Warehousing with Azure Data Factory

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **Sales & Marketing Data Warehouse** for *Adventure Works Cycles*.  
It leverages:
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** for ETL workflows  
- **Azure Data Studio** for querying OLTP & OLAP databases  
- **Azure SQL Database** for structured storage  

The solution enables **business intelligence analytics** across sales and marketing, supporting **customer segmentation, discount impact analysis, demand forecasting, and trend analysis**.

---

## Objectives
- Build a centralized **sales & marketing data warehouse**.  
- Design and automate **ETL pipelines** using Azure Data Factory.  
- Transform normalized **OLTP databases â†’ denormalized OLAP schema**.  
- Provide insights for **decision-making** in sales optimization, campaign performance, and forecasting.

## Methodology
1. **ETL Pipelines**  
   - Data extracted from transactional sources.  
   - Cleaned, transformed, and loaded into the data warehouse.  

2. **Star-Schema Architecture**  
   - Fact tables: Sales, Marketing, Discounts.  
   - Dimension tables: Customers, Products, Time, Geography.  

3. **Analytics Layer**  
   - Customer segmentation (loyal vs. new buyers).
